_FECS:_Fast_Electronic_Circuits_Simulator_
This software was used to approximate the behavior of electronic circuits
in my PhD thesis. It utilizes the Capacitor Substitution Method (CSM) to
transform electronic circuits into electric circuits described by ordinary
differential equations. The concept of CSM is thoroughly explained in the
thesis (http://www.fit.vut.cz/study/DP/PD.php?id=623&file=t) and whenever
I speak about chapters, it is there you should look.

_Dependencies_
The software is written for Linux and uses following programs/libraries:
- C++ compiler (e.g. g++),
- pthread,
- make,
- lex,
- yacc.
